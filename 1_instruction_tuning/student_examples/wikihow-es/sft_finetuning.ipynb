Asimismo, ser치 de utilidad para escoger ganadores de obsequios, ya que eliminar치 las preferencias o errores humanos que se cometen al escoger a un ganador (en el caso de que el ganador se elija al azar). Existen muchas p치ginas web que puedes emplear con este fin. Estas son algunas disponibles:  Random.org; Random Number Generator/Picker; Random Choice Generator; Research Randomizer; Generador de n칰meros aleatorios de Intemodino Group; Random Number Generator de Rechner Online; Custom Random Number Generator. La mayor parte de estas p치ginas web tan solo te pedir치n tu primer y 칰ltimo n칰mero, y generar치n un n칰mero dentro de ese rango. Otros podr칤an solicitar m치s informaci칩n, como Research Randomizer, el cual es de utilidad para los estudios de investigaci칩n. Al hacer clic, el programa ejecutar치 un algoritmo que elegir치 un n칰mero de manera aleatoria, el cual se encontrar치 dentro del rango que hayas indicado. Documenta el n칰mero o los n칰meros generados seg칰n lo requieras. Si vas a emplear esta herramienta para asignar n칰meros a participantes de manera aleatoria, debes contar con un documento en el cual coloques todos los n칰meros generados. Para documentarlos, puedes usar tablas, hojas de c치lculo o listas, y puedes registrar estos n칰meros en tu computadora o a mano en un papel impreso.', 'english_section_name': 'Using an Online Random Generator', 'english_url': 'https://www.wikihow.com/Randomize', 'url': 'https://es.wikihow.com/realizar-una-distribuci%C3%B3n-aleatoria', 'input_ids': [1, 4093, 198, 47416, 51, 7342, 15771, 1345, 463, 280, 810, 81, 1006, 762, 19086, 12814, 34789, 1508, 542, 47, 2, 198, 1, 520, 9531, 198, 1653, 6160, 3662, 1121, 551, 304, 16148, 763, 95, 253, 252, 376, 15634, 266, 30, 3906, 14921, 1102, 991, 11015, 34789, 1508, 1119, 430, 303, 6160, 12504, 10168, 649, 695, 280, 31798, 30, 1712, 10213, 252, 376, 304, 16148, 763, 395, 430, 1102, 991, 11015, 34789, 1508, 1119, 430, 303, 6160, 12504, 10168, 1102, 5271, 292, 30, 16646, 539, 286, 430, 1102, 6543, 12814, 20819, 991, 280, 7269, 304, 16148, 763, 95, 34789, 1508, 1119, 30, 2, 198, 1, 520, 9531, 198]}\n",

S칤rvete una bebida.', 'document': 'Ingerir ingredientes picantes puede hacer que tus gl치ndulas sudor칤paras trabajen horas adicionales. Tambi칠n estimula el metabolismo y puede incluso fortalecer el sistema inmunitario, lo cual hace que sea una opci칩n que no tiene pierde. Las cocinas como la mexicana, la tailandesa, la india y la vietnamita son famosas por sus comidas ardientes.  Prepara cualquier comida con un pu침ado de pimientos picantes picados en cubos, un chorro de salsa picante o una pizca de pimienta de Cayena. Toma un vaso de leche durante una pausa para neutralizar el calor si empieza a ponerse insoportable. Prep치rate una taza humeante de caf칠, de t칠 o de chocolate caliente y t칩mala mientras est칠 fresca. El calor elevar치 tu temperatura central desde el interior. Si ya est치s en un ambiente c치lido, tus poros no tardar치n mucho en abrirse. Las bebidas calientes son una manera efectiva de entrar en calor si est치s apurado. Esta es parte de la raz칩n por la que son tan populares entre los esquiadores, los alpinistas y otros atletas de clima fr칤o. El caf칠, la gaseosa y el chocolate deben ser alimentos b치sicos en tu dieta. La cafe칤na estimula directamente el sistema nervioso central. La sudoraci칩n es una respuesta del sistema nervioso. Solo ten cuidado de no exagerar o puedes empezar a temblar.  Si no te va bien con el caf칠, lim칤tate a propuestas con cantidades menos concentradas de cafe칤na como t칠 verde. Si todo lo dem치s no da resultado, toma una bebida energ칠tica enlatada. Estos productos suelen contener 200 mg de cafe칤na por porci칩n. Rel치jate al final de un largo d칤a con un par de cervezas o un poco de vino tinto. Incluso una peque침a cantidad de alcohol pueden hacer que tu sangre bombee r치pidamente. Con el tiempo, esto puede conducir al enrojecimiento, a los bochornos y (s칤, lo adivinaste) a la transpiraci칩n.  No es necesario decir que esto solo ser치 una opci칩n si tienes la edad legal para tomar alcohol. Evita tomar alcohol en exceso. No ayudar치 a que sudes m치s, pero puede alterara tu juicio y causar verg칲enza potencialmente.', 'english_section_name': 'Eating and Drinking', 'english_url': 'https://www.wikihow.com/Sweat-More', 'url': 'https://es.wikihow.com/sudar-m%C3%A1s', 'input_ids': [1, 4093, 198, 47416, 51, 7342, 15771, 393, 31368, 372, 31798, 47, 2, 198, 1, 520, 9531, 198, 34056, 360, 2572, 395, 18662, 37168, 30, 312, 4826, 35836, 325, 82, 5187, 1588, 1010, 85, 30, 2913, 2522, 283, 31798, 1020, 4565, 6160, 3546, 30, 334, 6160, 98, 20862, 85, 35836, 325, 82, 5187, 30, 2, 198, 1, 520, 9531, 198]}\n",
